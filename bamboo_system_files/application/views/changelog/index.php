<h4>From 0.8.8 to 0.8.9 (Released April 15, 2009)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Updated to CodeIgniter 1.7.1.</li>
	<li>Added an option (on by default) to display the first 50 characters (approximately) of the first item of any invoice on the invoices summary page.</li>
	<li>The invoice filename is now saved with the i18n version of "invoice".</li>
	<li>Reports can now do any year, and not only the current year.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where password potentially got double encoded during reset.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where tax exempt clients had the tax checkbox checked when creating a new item.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where quotes were converted to ? in the PDF.</li>
	<li>Fixed a possible rounding error when retrieving all invoices.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug when resetting the password of an admin who isn't the primary.</li>
	<li>Added in a few more language keys for untranslated text.</li>
	<li>Optimized the login process, should be quicker now (but I doubt any human would notice... robots on the other hand, those guys are crafty).</li>
	<li>Added a hidden config variable to customize the filename of the database backup file.</li>
	<li>Moved "blind copy me on this email", and "donate" into a language variable.</li>
	<li>Added Estonian language pack.</li>
	<li>Modified DOMPDF to make it run a bit faster by fixing a uniqid() call.</li>
	<li>Removed ".00" from quantity listings, so now a quantity of "5.00" will simply say "5".</li>
	<li>Removed the "work description" heading before the table on invoice views. I feel it was superfluous.</li>
	<li>Removed an inadvertent "database backup" heading from utilities.</li>
	<li>Informational messages such as "invoice successfully edited" will no longer print.</li>
	<li>Changed the maximum length of invoices to 50 characters.</li>
	<li>Date formatting is now configurable via a hidden config option.</li>
	<li>Increased spacing in invoice item lines for added readability.</li>
	<li>Increased the invoice note field to 2000 characters.</li>
	<li>Dutch language pack is now improved.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.dmsdesigns.nl">Ilco Everraert</a>.</li>
	<li>French language pack is now improved.  Thanks to Jeremy Bunlon.</li>
	<li><em>Behaviour change</em>: prior to 0.8.9, changing the email under settings would only change the address used when sending emails, and not the login email. Changing it now also changes the login.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Updated to CodeIgniter 1.7.0.</li>

	<li>Invoices now detail amount paid and owing if an invoice has partial payments applied to it.</li>
	<li>The date an invoice is due is now visible on the invoice itself beside "payment terms".</li>
	<li>Expanded the email field for client contacts to 127 characters.</li>
	<li>Added "tax code" to the information about a client, particularly useful for countries that require printing a client's taxcode by law.</li>
	<li>Added the hidden config variable "<kbd>$config['currency_decimal'] = '.';</kbd>" to allow the separator between dollars and cents to be a non '.' if wanted.  For example: $24.67 vs $24,67 vs $24_67... or whatever.</li>
	<li>Added a hidden config variable to allow output of a profiler on each page... if you're hacking Bamboo, enable <kbd>$config['show_profiler'] = TRUE;</kbd></li>
	<li>Moved invoice payment into model.</li>
	<li>Added a Danish language pack (thanks <a href="http://www.gratisdomaene.tk/">Ren√© Gylling</a>!), but it still uses English system messages.</li>
	<li>Added a 'logo_base_url' hidden configuration option to force the image path on some servers for PDF generation.</li>

	<li>Fixed a bug where incorrect maxlengths were added to client contact information.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where accented characters would display garbled in some fields.</li>
	<li>Fixed a link generated over Ajax that may be broken on some server setups.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where total wasn't updated after an item was removed.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where some international characters were getting double encoded in payment notes and private history.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where settings would report an error if no update was made.</li>
	<li>The ongoing task of cleaning up code still continues... and I absolutely <em>must</em> get Bamboo into jQuery and out of scriptaculous (its a personal preference, there's nothing technically wrong with scripto).</li>
</ul>

<h4>From 0.8.6 to 0.8.7 (Released August 25, 2008)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Naming changes on "private" invoice notes.</li>
	<li>Further adjustments to how logos get included.	I think this time all the issues are resolved.</li>

	<li>Moved "download backup" to a language variable.</li>
	<li>Moved logo insertion code into a centralized location.</li>

</ul>

<h4>From 0.8.4 to 0.8.5 (Released May 20, 2008)</h4>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The update to 0.8.5 requires that you are already on 0.8.3 or 0.8.4 - unlike previous versions, Bamboo <em>will not</em> walk you through incremental updates (ie: from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2 and then to 0.8.3).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Added per invoice Notes functionality.</li>

	<li>Added a proper installer, much sexier and easier. Bamboo now uses DB Forge and fully supports table prefixes (hardcoded SQL previously didn't allow for this).</li>
	<li>Added full and true database prefix abstracting. There were several places where SQL was hardcoded... messing things up tremendously.</li>
	<li>Turned off logging by default. Non-writable folders where causing a lot of grief for people.</li>

	<li>Swedish language pack added.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Changed a few language keys.</li>
</ul>


<h4>From 0.8.2 to 0.8.3</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Added itemized invoice capability. This involved a major re-architecting of the underlying code.</li>
	<li>Added per item tax information (you can mark individual items as taxable or not) .</li>
	<li>Some models autoloaded now.</li>
	<li>Removed the deprecated &quot;scripts&quot; used.</li>
	<li>Added a monthly title when looking at invoices in summary format to quickly tell invoices from different months.</li>

	<li>Fixed a bug that prevented	special characters from rendering in a client name when searching dynamically .</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that caused an error when invoice number was left blank.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug that caused overpaid invoices not to register as closed, in fact - rebuilt most of the &quot;status&quot; code to eliminate bugs .</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Notes</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>In order to accommodate itemized invoices, amount, work_description, and some tax information was migrated to a new table &quot;invoice_items&quot;.</li>
	<li>Previously, due to an oversight, an invoice was considered &quot;closed&quot; if the amount paid was &gt;= the amount owing <em>not considering</em> tax. This has been changed. For example, a $100 invoice with $7 tax will not be considered &quot;closed&quot; until $107 (or more) is entered in the payment. Previously, $100 would have marked it closed. .</li>
	<li>Some lines lack appropriate translation, or are machine translated. I'd be grateful for any improvements non-English speakers could suggest.</li>
